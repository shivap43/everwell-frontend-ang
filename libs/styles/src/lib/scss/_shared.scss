/* SHARED STYLES BARREL
 *
 * This file rolls up a minimized list of variables & functions required for component styling.
 * Unlike the main entry file for applications (`styles.scss`), this file should only include the *bare* minimums required for component styling.
 * For more information on this project's Sass architecture SEE: /libs/shared/src/lib/scss/README.md
